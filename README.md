# Amazon Survey Analysis

### Project Background

Amazon, the largest e-commerce company in the world, sells a wide variety of consumer products online from its warehouses and third-party vendors. An existing dataset contains Amazon survey responses that provides a look into customer perceptions towards the company and their interactions with its online platform. The purpose of this project is to uncover any patterns in consumer behavior and understand what Amazon needs to improve with its online platform so that customers can have a better shopping experience. 

Insights and Recommendations are provided on the following North Star Metrics:

* **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):** A metric that demonstrates consumers overall satisfaction with Amazon. This is calculated using the shopping_satisfaction variable that uses a likert scale (1 = Very Unsatisfied to 5 = Very Satisfied). 

* **Personalized Recommendation Accuracy:** A metric that demonstrates how accurate consumers believe Amazon's personalized recommendation are. This is calculated using the recommendation_accuracy variable that uses a likert scale (1 = Very Inaccurate to 5 = Very Accurate). 

* **Perception of Customer Reviews:** A metric that demonstrates how much consumers value reviews when making decisions. This is calculated using the customers_review_importance variable that uses a likert scale (1 = Very Unimportant to 5 = Very Important).
